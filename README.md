# microponics

Proof of concept for a microk8s-based cluster of machines where each node (i.e., constituent machine)

*  is a Raspberry Pi,
*  is connected to a set of sensors (and other equipment such as peristaltic pumps), and
* monitors and manages a single hydroponics system (grow) that is
  - primarily set up as a deep water culture (DWC) system, and
  - consists of a single plant.

This is an entirely experimental "passion" project and the future of its development is completely uncertain.
